# The Legend of Zelda for the NES recreated in C++ using SDL

This is a school project from the first year of Game design and programming at Uppsala University.
The specific course is Game Programming 1.

The task was to recreate a classic game in about a month, although since the assignement overlapped the holidays I only worked on
it for about two weeks. All of the source code outside of SDL was written entirely by me. My goal was to create the first four levels of
the original The Legend of Zelda game for the NES, including the starting cave where you retrieve the sword.
