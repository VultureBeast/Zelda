- Advanced Features -

No Memory Leaks
The game in its currrent state has no memory leaks, it handles all the data on the heap well and deletes it when it's it no longer has a purpouse.
Spread across most files.

Animations
The abilty to play animation of sprites with 4 parts.
The animation can be set on a loop, or played once and return a false bool when finished to trigger events.
Can be found in Animation.h, Animation.cpp, and SpriteManager.cpp, and is seen used in most files.
(The sprites themselves can be found in the Sprites folder)

Artificial intelegence
While not the greatest AI, it does what it's supposed to do (Most of the time).
It has three things that it does: First it spawnes, then it moves, and when it finds a new direction, it fires a projectile.
It does also despawn, bu that's mainly handled by the Level and not the AI.
Can be found in Enemy.cpp.

Data driven entity creation
The Tile data for the levels are gathered from .txt files found in the Data folder.
In the Level.h and Level.cpp you can see it be imported and put into a map.

"Show me what you got"
I guess this would be the WorldManager that handles the Switching Between the levels.
It's not too complicated, but I think the feature is very neat and it was really fun to do.
Can be found in WorldManager.h and WorldManager.cpp as well as the Level.cpp.
